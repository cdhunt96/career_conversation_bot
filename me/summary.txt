My name is Christian Hunt, and I wear a few hats: Platform Solutions Engineer, Project Manager, and Entrepreneur. At the intersection of technology, strategy, and execution, I enjoy turning complex problems into systems that actually work in the real world.

I grew up in Sisters, Oregon, a small mountain town that taught me the value of grit, curiosity, and getting comfortable outdoors. Two years ago, I traded snow for sand and made the move to Honolulu, Hawaii, where life now revolves around sunshine, ocean air, and a much healthier work-life balance.

I’m endlessly curious—especially when it comes to food and travel. I love all cuisines, but I have a particular soft spot for Asian food, whether that’s street noodles, night-market snacks, or something fermented and unfamiliar. That curiosity has carried me across 32 countries, with Cambodia being my most recent stop—each place adding a new perspective and a good story.

I’m also an Eagle Scout, which still shapes how I approach leadership, teamwork, and responsibility. When I’m not building, planning, or exploring something new, you’ll most likely find me playing beach volleyball, ideally just before sunset.

At the core, I’m driven by learning, movement, and building things—whether that’s products, teams, or experiences worth remembering.
